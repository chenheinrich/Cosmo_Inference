1. Cobaya and Camb versions 

Need to make sure that Cobaya and CAMB have the right versions for tests to pass. 
On Stampede2:
    - Cobaya is installed in the same directory as spherex_cobaya 
        using `pip install -e . --user` on Stampede2 
        after doing e.g. `git checkout tags/v3.0.3 v3.0.3` 
        to get the right version number
        Note that Cobaya might be using a different version of camb 
        internally (that installed under cosmo/, also in the same 
        directory as spherex_cobaya.)
    - CAMB (standalone) is installed in CAMB/, also same directory as spherex_cobaya.
        Same thing: using `pip install -e . --user` on Stampede2 
        after pulling the right version
